-   Smoother project-based collaboration
    -   renv
        -   set up environment
        -   necessary vs helper packages (imports vs suggests)
    -   styler/lintr
        -   exercise: copy and paste code that is wrong. Run lintr and
            see errors. Run styler to fix some of them up.
            -   include something like `{{}}`
        -   create a function in R to do it more efficiently (for
            styler)
    -   Quarto visual/canonical mode.
    -   Precommits
        -   exercise: copy and paste wrong code. Try to add and commit
            to Git history.
    -   Optional: Maybe reprex when trying to get help?
    -   Code of conduct and contributing guides?
