### Exercise: Make figures prettier

> Time: \~25 minutes

Looking through the [Cell
Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)
documentation, complete these tasks.

-   Add a `fig-cap` option to each of the figures.

-   For the distribution and variation plots, set the code chunk option
    `column` to `page` to make it bigger.

Look through the `{ggplot2}` documentation on `theme_set()` and
`theme()` to update the look of all your figures. In the `setup` code
chunk of the `doc/report.Rmd` file, make a new theme object and use
`theme_set()` to apply that theme to all plots. Use this as a scaffold:

```{{{r setup}}}
# ... previous code
updated_theme <- theme(
  # ... make changes
)

# Or start with a template like theme_classic()

updated_theme <- theme_TEMPLATE() +
  theme(
    # ...
  )

theme_set(updated_theme)
```
