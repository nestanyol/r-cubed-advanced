# Extra exercises

## Building a website with Quarto

### Exercise: Look through the new website folder

> Time: \~5 minutes.

In your main project folder, there should now be a folder called
`_site/`. Look through the folder. What files are now created? Open up
the `index.html` file in your browser while in RStudio by clicking the
`index.html` file and then selecting the "Open in web browser".

<!-- TODO: Confirm the name of the website folder. -->

Recall how we described what a website is. Can you see how these files
and folders are simply HTML files that the browser shows as website? In
the browser URL, change the `index.html` ending link to
`doc/report.html`. See how it changes to the file based on how it is
structured in the folder?

### Exercise: Make figures prettier

> Time: \~25 minutes

Looking through the [Cell
Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)
documentation, complete these tasks.

-   Add a `fig-cap` option to each of the figures.

-   For the distribution and variation plots, set the code chunk option
    `column` to `page` to make it bigger.

Look through the `{ggplot2}` documentation on `theme_set()` and
`theme()` to update the look of all your figures. In the `setup` code
chunk of the `doc/report.Rmd` file, make a new theme object and use
`theme_set()` to apply that theme to all plots. Use this as a scaffold:

```{{r setup}}
# ... previous code
updated_theme <- theme(
  # ... make changes
)

# Or start with a template like theme_classic()

updated_theme <- theme_TEMPLATE() +
  theme(
    # ...
  )

theme_set(updated_theme)
```
