More frequently, our work include a high level\ncollaboration on scientific projects, and consequently many new\nchallenges arise that we as researchers do not have the training for nor\nknowledge on how to resolve. Challenges include:\n\n-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to\n    read or review each others code;\n\n-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project in order to\n    synchronize computing environments among the collaborators and\n    potentially servers;\n\n-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,\n    and present the data and findings in a way that allows collaborators\n    to re-generate the most recent results.\n\nTraining and awareness of the skills and knowledge necessary to create\nreproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines are still very much\nlacking for researchers. Partly due to this gap, how *exactly* an\nanalysis is done to produce a given result is poorly, if at all,\ndescribed in scientific studies. This could have major impact on the\nreproducibility an ultimately the reliablity of studies.\n\nThis course is designed to address these issues in code-along sessions\n(instructor and learner coding together), reading activities, and\nexercises using real-world datasets. This website contains all of the\nmaterial for the course, from reading material to exercises to images.\nIt is structured as a book, with \"chapters\" as lessons, given in order\nof appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the course\nwhere code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly\nexactly (with slight modifications for time or more detailed\nexplanations).\n\nThe course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to\nwrite the lessons and create the book format,\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\nrepository of the material, and [GitHub\nActions](https://github.com/features/actions) with\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The\noriginal source material for this course is found on the\n[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)\nGitHub repository.\n\nWant to contribute to this course?
