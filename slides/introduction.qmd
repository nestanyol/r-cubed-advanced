## Question: How many of you work on your own?

## Question: How many of you want to work more closely with others?

-   :heavy_check_mark: Go to your assigned table and group (see list)
-   :heavy_check_mark: Introduce yourself to your group members
-   :heavy_check_mark: Open your `LearnR3.Rproj` RStudio project
-   :heavy_check_mark: Make sure your `data-raw/` looks like the thing
    on the side
    -   **NO** other files should be there besides these (some of you
        have other files and folders)
    -   If not, re-do the pre-course download data tasks and ask us for
        help
-   :heavy_check_mark: Just in case, do
    `r3::install_packages_advanced()`

## Motivation for this course

## `r emo::ji("shrug")`...Because code sharing is almost non-existent in science

### Code sharing: From scientific principle of "reproducibility"

## These issues can be fixed by creating and nurturing a culture of openness

## Goal of this course? Start changing the culture by providing the training {.center}

## Course setup and layout

-   Course is mix of:

    -   "Code-alongs" (we type and explain, you type along)
    -   Hands-on coding, discussing, and reading exercises

-   True to our mission, material publicly accessible and [openly
    licensed](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/license.html)
    (<https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/>)

-   [Resources
    Appendix](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/resources.html)

    -   Material for further learning
    -   Useful R packages to use

## Advanced is less about coding and more about connecting with others

-   Each table is a group name, each day you'll switch tables

-   During lunch, try to sit besides someone you don't know or know less
    than the others.

### Getting or asking for help `r emo::ji("raising_hand_woman")`

\- Put the sticky on your laptop to get help

\- There are lots of helpers

\- Team members, help out too

\- We're all learning here!

\- This is a supportive and safe environment

\- Remember our [Code of Conduct](conduct.html)\]

### Practice using stickies: Does your `data-raw/` look as this?

### Activity: Stand and arrange based on question

We're going to do a "stand and re-arrange yourself" activity based on
some questions I ask.

### How do you perceive your skill in R?

Along the wall, arrange to one side is "novice/basic" and other side is
"advanced".

### Who has had formal training in specifically *coding* in R or in general?

Staying where you are, raise your hand if you would answer yes to this
question. If it was part of a statistics course, it doesn't really
count.

### Who has struggled with using R?

Again, staying where you are, raise your hand if you've struggled or
still struggle with R?

## Now back to your seat

## We are always looking to improve the course

### So your feedback is so helpful and important `r emo::ji("grin")`
