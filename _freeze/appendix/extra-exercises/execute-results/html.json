    "markdown": "# Extra exercises\n\n## A general approach to doing statistical analyses\n\n### Exercise: How would you define a linear regression with parsnip?\n\n> Time: \\~10 minutes.\n\nUsing [parsnip's \"Examples\"\nvignette](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/articles/Examples.html) as well\nas the code we wrote for the logistic regression above as a template,\nwrite `{parsnip}` code that would define a simple (an engine of`\"lm\"`)\nlinear regression model. Begin by making a new Markdown header and code\nchunk at the bottom of the `doc/learning.qmd` file, like listed below:\n\n````         \n## Exercises\n### Linear regression model definition\n\n```{{r}}\n\n```\n````\n\nAfter writing the code, style the file using {{< var keybind.styler >}}.\nWe will eventually delete these exercise text in the Quarto file, but\nfor now, commit the changes to the Git history with\n{{< var keybind.git >}}.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"**Click for the solution**. Only click if you are struggling or are out of time.\"}\nlinear_reg_specs <- linear_reg() %>%\n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Building a website with Quarto\n\n### Exercise: Look through the new website folder\n\n> Time: \\~5 minutes.\n\nIn your main project folder, there should now be a folder called\n`_site/`. Look through the folder. What files are now created? Open up\nthe `index.html` file in your browser while in RStudio by clicking the\n`index.html` file and then selecting the \"Open in web browser\".\n\n<!-- TODO: Confirm the name of the website folder. -->\n\nRecall how we described what a website is. Can you see how these files\nand folders are simply HTML files that the browser shows as website? In\nthe browser URL, change the `index.html` ending link to\n`doc/report.html`. See how it changes to the file based on how it is\nstructured in the folder?\n\n### Exercise: Make figures prettier\n\n> Time: \\~25 minutes\n\nLooking through the [Cell\nReference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)\ndocumentation, complete these tasks.\n\n-   Add a `fig-cap` option to each of the figures.\n\n-   For the distribution plot, set the code chunk option `column` to\n    `page` to make it bigger.\n\nLook through the `{ggplot2}` documentation on `theme_set()` and\n`theme()` to update the look of all your figures. In the `setup` code\nchunk of the `doc/learning.qmd` file, make a new theme object and use\n`theme_set()` to apply that theme to all plots. Use this as a scaffold:\n\n```{{r setup}}\n# ... previous code\nupdated_theme <- theme(\n  # ... make changes\n)\n\n# Or start with a template like theme_classic()\n\nupdated_theme <- theme_TEMPLATE() +\n  theme(\n    # ...\n  )\n\ntheme_set(updated_theme)\n```\n\n",
