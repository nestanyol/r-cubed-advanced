# Extras

-   Optional: Maybe talk about Git remotes when collaborating? Eg, set
    up remote on server? through gert?
    -   As a side aspect, appendix?
    -   mention pr\_ helpers?
-   One exercise could be to do the same thing but with the larger
    lipidomics dataset.
-   Precommits
    -   exercise: copy and paste wrong code. Try to add and commit to
        Git history.
-   PR commands for styler?
-   PR helpers with usethis?
-   reprex?

could even use

use_github_action("style")

this might be an extra.
