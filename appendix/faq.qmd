## I have an issue with installing packages, what do I do?

This could be due to many many issues. Here are a few things you can
try:

-   Close all programs and open up RStudio again to try to restart.

-   Set your anti-virus software to allow installing packages from CRAN
    or GitHub/GitLab. Sometimes the anti-virus software will
    automatically send you a notification to allow them, but maybe not
    always, so you might have to check the settings of your software.
