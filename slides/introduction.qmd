# Motivation for this course

## Largely from desire for more effective collaboration {.center}

::: notes
Relate to UK Biobank project: <https://github.com/steno-aarhus/ukbAid>
:::

## But also from larger trends in research and society {.center}

### Like reproducibility

::: notes
Ask who knows what reproducibility is and could explain it.
:::

## Goal of course: Create and nurture a culture of openness through training {.center}

## Advanced is less about coding and more about connecting with others

-   Each table is a group name, each day you'll switch tables

-   During lunch, try to sit besides someone you don't know or know less
    than the others.

## How do you perceive your skill in R?

Along the wall, arrange to one side is "novice/basic" and other side is
"advanced".

### Who has had formal training in specifically *coding* in R or in general?

Staying where you are, raise your hand if you would answer yes to this
question. If it was part of a statistics course, it doesn't really
count.

### Who has struggled with using R?

Again, staying where you are, raise your hand if you've struggled or
still struggle with R?
