## The Big Picture

::: callout-note
## Reading task: \~10 minutes

This section provides a bigger picture view of what we will be doing,
why we want to do it, how we will be going about doing it, and what it
will look like in the end.

Our big picture aim is:

> We want to create a data analysis project that:
>
> 1.  Makes it easier for direct contributions from collaborators and
>     others,
> 2.  Allows us to write processing and analysis steps (as code) in a
>     more explicit and ultimately reproducible way,
> 3.  Incorporates general-purpose tools that simplify using (or
>     switching) statistical analysis methods, and
> 4.  Enables quick dissemination of results by creating a
>     project-specific website.
>
> All of which will be exemplified through a simple analysis of a
> lipidomics study.

<!-- TODO: Pipeline, workflow image? -->

How will it look like in the end, in a more "tangible" way? The most
tangible thing are the folders and files on our computers. The folder
and file structures below show where we start and where we end, so you
can hopefully get a better understanding of how things look. Right now,
everyone's initial project structure should look like:

    LearnR3
    ├── data/
    │   ├── lipidomics.rda
    │   └── README.md
    ├── data-raw/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── nmr-omics/
    │   │  ├── lipidomics.xlsx
    │   │  └── README.txt
    │   └── nmr-omics.R
    ├── doc/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── report.Rmd
    │   └── lesson.Rmd
    ├── R/
    │   ├── functions.R
    │   └── README.md
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── DESCRIPTION
    ├── LearnR3.Rproj
    ├── README.md
    └── TODO.md

<!-- At the end of this course, it should look something like: -->

<!-- TODO: Paste from final output of running code in -->

Why do we structure it this way?

-   To follow "project-oriented" workflows (covered in
    @sec-smoother-collaboration).
-   To follow some standard conventions in R, like having a
    `DESCRIPTION` file (which is important for
    @sec-smoother-collaboration).
-   To keep types of files separate, like raw data raw and in the
    `data-raw/` folder, R scripts/functions in the `R/` folder, and
    documents like R Markdown files in `doc/`.

This also supports our workflow and processes, which will be something
like:

-   Install packages in a project-specific environment to track package
    dependencies.
-   Follow "function-oriented" workflows, where we use R Markdown
    (`doc/lesson.Rmd`) to write and test out code, convert it into a
    function, test it, and then move it into `R/functions.R`.
    -   Developing functions in the R Markdown document makes it a bit
        easier to quickly test code out and make sure it works before
        moving the code over into a more formal location and structure.
        Think of using the R Markdown file as a sandbox to test out and
        play with code, without fear of messing things up.
    -   We also test code out in the R Markdown *from a teaching and
        learning perspective* because it's easier to show and weave in
        text and comments with code as we do the code-alongs. It also
        forces you to practice working within R Markdown documents,
        which are key components to a reproducible workflow in R.
    -   We keep the functions in a separate file because we will
        frequently `source()` from it as we prototype and test out code
        in the R Markdown file. It also creates a clear separation
        between "finalized" code and prototyping code.
-   Use `doc/lesson.Rmd` as an exploring and testing document, like a
    sandbox analogy used above, while using `doc/report.Rmd` as the
    document to structure our analysis and results. If needed we can
    easily delete everything in the `doc/lesson.Rmd` file.
-   Use a combination of restarting R (`Ctrl-Shift-F10` or
    `Session -> Restart R`) and using `source()` (`Ctrl-Shift-S` while
    in `R/functions.R`) to run the functions inside of `R/functions.R`.
    -   We restart R because it is the only certain way to ensure that
        the R workspace is completely clear. For reproducibility, we
        should always aim to work from a "clean plate".
-   Keeping code readable by frequently (automatically) checking the
    formatting/styling of our code.
-   For each "output" in a paper (like a figure or table), write one or
    more functions to complete the output and include those functions as
    "targets" or steps in a pipeline. Use this explicit pipeline to
    track which steps need to be re-run and in which order for your data
    analysis.
-   Write accompanying text (or full paper) for the analysis in Markdown
    so we can easily and quickly build websites (or Word docs) of our
    work, for rapid dissemination.
-   Automatically reformat Markdown text into a standard, more readable
    format.
-   Whenever we complete a task, we *add and commit* those file changes
    and save them into the Git history.
    -   We use Git because it is the best way of keeping track of what
        was done to your files, when, and why. It keeps your work
        transparent and makes it easier to share your code by uploading
        to GitHub. Using version control should be a standard practice
        to doing better science since it fits with the philosophy of
        doing science.
