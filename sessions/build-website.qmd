Intro

## Learning objectives

The overall objective for this session is to:

1.  Explain what a website is, what minimum files are needed, and how to
    use Quarto as a framework for creating them and including them as
    part of a pipeline.

More specific objectives are to:

1.  Describe how websites are essentially folders and files, where some
    files need to be named a specific way (like the `index.html` file).
2.  Explain how Quarto executes R code in a document and creates
    different file formats from it, like Word or HTML. Use Quarto's YAML
    header options, like `format: docx` or `format: html`, to create
    different file outputs.
3.  Use the `_quarto.yml` file along with Quarto options to apply the
    understanding of how websites work and to build then them.
4.  Use GitHub Actions to automate generating and uploading the website,
    then demonstrate how to make the material open by adding a license
    to the repository.
5.  Continue applying the concepts and functions used from the previous
    sessions.

## What is a website and why create one?

## What is Quarto and why use it?

## Exercise: Convert R Markdown YAML to Quarto style

add affiliation, author name, etc

try creating a word document.

## Using Quarto to build a project website

Need to create an `index.qmd` file and a `_quarto.yml` file.

```{r}
fs::file_create("_quarto.yml")
fs::file_create("index.qmd")
```

``` yml
project:
  type: website
```

``` yml
website:
  title: "UPDATE"
  search: true
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: doc/report.Rmd
        text: "Report"
```

-   Displaying your output in reproducible formats: quarto website
    -   yml, navbar, contents

``` yml
format:
  html:
    theme: litera
```

``` yml
knitr:
  opts_chunk:
    echo: false
```

## Exercise: Add website as a pipeline target

`tar_quarto()`

``` yml
editor_options:
  markdown:
  wrap: 72
  canonical: true
```

## Automate rendering the website

-   Combine with freeze?

``` yml
execute:
  freeze: auto
```

-   Connect to GitHub and make website

    -   Actions?

## Exercise: Add license to repository

-   Add link to GitHub description section.

-   Update README with link.

-   License? Probably good idea.

    -   use_ccby_license()

``` yml
website:
  ...
  page-footer:
    center:
      - text: "License: CC BY 4.0"
```

## Exercise: Make figures prettier

-   Make ggplot2 figures nicer, as an exercise? Add the theme to each
    plot or with theme_set()
-   Add figure captions, fig heights, widths
    -   using quarto style code
-   Make table of model estimates and variation?
