# Networking and social activities

## Day 1 {#social-day-1 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get in your group and go for a walk outside (if it's nice
out). Share and discuss with your group these questions:

-   Why are you here and what do you want to learn besides R?
-   How do you currently collaborate with others and are you happy with
    it? Share a memorable positive or negative experience you have had
    related to collaboration. Why was it positive or negative? It
    doesn't have to be about coding in R or data analysis, it can be
    collaboration in general.

## Day 2 {#social-day-2 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get in your group and talk about these questions and
topics. You can walk outside, find a table, or do whatever.

-   What would you spend your work time on if you had learned efficient
    and effective coding skills earlier in your career and were in a
    research culture that encouraged sharing and supporting these
    skills?
-   If instead of working, you could take those extra hours saved from
    being efficient for personal activities, what would you spend your
    time on?
