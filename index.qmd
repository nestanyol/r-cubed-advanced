Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded
of, and needed by, scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. More frequently, our research work environments and
projects include or require a high level of hands-on collaboration on
scientific projects, especially on the data analysis, writing, and
visualization stages of a research project. In a collaborative setting
like this, many new challenges arise that we as researchers do not have
the training for or knowledge on how to best resolve them. Challenges
include:

-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to
    read or review each other's code;

-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project in order to
    synchronize computing environments among the collaborators and
    potentially servers;

-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,
    and present the data and findings in a way that allows collaborators
    to re-generate the most recent results.

Even without being in collaborative settings, solutions to these
challenges can also streamline solo work on projects that are
infrequently worked on or when research results need to be independently
reproduced or audited with minimal effort for everyone involved.

Training on, and awareness of, the skills and knowledge necessary to
create reproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines is still
very much lacking for researchers. Due to this gap and other factors,
how *exactly* an analysis is done to produce a given result is poorly,
if at all, described in scientific studies. This hidden aspect of
research could have major impacts on the reproducibility of studies.
This course aims to provide training to help address these particular
issues.

The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons,
where the instructor and learner code together, and is interspersed with
hands-on exercises, reading, and group work using real-world datasets.
This website contains all of the material for the course, from reading
material to exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with
"chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make heavy use
of the website throughout the course where code-along sessions follow
the material on the website nearly exactly (with slight modifications
for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitLab
CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create the website. The original
source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)
GitLab repository.
